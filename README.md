MTM Course Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my repository, where I proudly present the outcomes of three compelling assignments from the esteemed MTM course at the CS Faculty, Technion. These projects serve as a testament to my journey through the intricate world of computer science, demonstrating my evolving skills and proficiency in various programming paradigms.

Project 1: C Assignment - Crafting Advanced Data Structures for Warehouse Management
In this initial venture, I delved into the realm of C programming, where I designed and implemented an Abstract Data Type (ADT) to manage a sophisticated amount set data structure. The project's focal point was the creation of a robust warehouse management system, equipped with an array of features. From controlling existing inventory to seamlessly adding new products, removing items, and efficiently managing shipping orders, this assignment showcased my adept command over C and intricate data structures.

Project 2: C++ Assignment - Navigating the World of Classes and Inheritance
In the realm of C++, I explored the intricacies of object-oriented programming through the lens of classes, inheritance, and more. The assignment centered around a city's job market, featuring two pivotal groupsâ€”employees and managers. Through the implementation, I illustrated their ability to acquire skills, navigate workplaces, and participate in the complex dynamics of professional life. This project stands as a testament to my proficiency in C++ and my grasp of object-oriented design principles.

Project 3: Python Mastery - Harnessing the Power of Input/Output and Strings
The Python assignment challenged me to harness the language's versatility in handling input/output operations, manipulating strings, and implementing a sophisticated system. The task involved creating a system capable of gracefully processing input files based on specific instructions. This project not only demonstrated my prowess in Python but also showcased my ability to handle complex tasks, including file manipulation, string operations, and overall programming finesse.

These projects collectively represent my dedication to mastering diverse programming domains during the MTM course at Technion's CS Faculty. As I reflect on these accomplishments, I am proud to have navigated through the intricacies of each assignment, solidifying my skills and knowledge in the process. Each line of code is a testament to my growth as a computer scientist, and I look forward to the challenges that lie ahead in this ever-evolving field.
